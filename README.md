    ①The first place can also choose to get 1 energy value (principal ＋12%), when accumulating 10 energy values,
    You can get a crystal, and opening the crystal can get an additional value return of more than 20%.
    
    ②The income is settled in B stable coins, and A is flash exchanged for $, with a 10% handling fee.
    
    ③Each game takes 1% fuel fee +1% car rental fee | Leaderboard - 4% of each completed game enters the leaderboard prize pool, the leaderboard is divided once every 7 days, the entire network is ranked by the number of glory NFTs obtained in each season. 1-10 place 30% mainstream currency, 11-20 place 30% B coin, 21-50 place 40% B coin.
    

### 2. Team income

Note: A valid account participates in at least 1 game per season, and the game account needs $100 at 0 o'clock every day.

## VIII. Core Goals of the Geeks Union

**Technical Route
Geeks Union Technical Route**

**1. Through continuous deep plowing and precipitation in the gamefi track, "Racer Expert" is realized in the web3 field. Evolution and expansion, becoming a standard plug-in for betting classic models.**

Through continuous deep plowing and precipitation in the gamefi track, "Racer Expert" is realized in the web3 field. Evolution and expansion, becoming a standard plug-in for betting classic models.
In the game world, the most basic algorithms in the economic model, including productivity output, centralized planning and distribution, and betting and bidding auctions. 

The logical algorithms in traditional games are usually borrowed in the blockchain games, but they are all their own algorithms, and they cannot realize the intercommunication and recognition of the underlying logic of the blockchain, which does not conform to the spirit of the blockchain. 

Betting and bidding auction is a routine algorithm, but it contains the most basic logic and economic distribution of the Web3 concept. 

Cross-chain games are the inevitable way for future games, and basic algorithms such as betting will become the basic plug-ins and standard protocols of chain games. 

But at present, the industry has not fully focused on this direction, they are all making applications, completely ignoring the core goals and the location and value of core value. 

The stunning release of the Geeks Union will be a milestone bridge linking the basic infrastructure and applications of the Gamefi track.

**2. Build the basic application of "Racer Expert" standard plug-in in the gamefi field: realize the nesting and economic model adaptation of third-party dapps.**
In the early stage of blockchain games, lightweight applications will flourish, various algorithms will emerge in an endless stream, styles will be chaotic, fish and dragons will be mixed, whether it is iterative innovation or shell disguise, the fundamental logic will not change. 

The Geeks Union focuses on the universal practice and openness of basic algorithms, promotes the landing and application of standard interfaces, and realizes two-way universality at the technical level and application level. 

Through universal practice, the Geeks Union can be hot-swapped into or nested in any application or DAPP. This will provide some motivation for the explosive growth of blockchain games.

 At the same time, with the concept of the web3 economic model, the Geeks Union will uphold the open economic logic, and users can customize the economic model locally, which will encourage any user using the Geeks Union standard protocol to build their own modular applications.
In addition, based on the standard protocol, the Geeks Union will open up the protocol itself, that is, users will be defaulted as curators after using the Geeks Union standard protocol.

**3. Through touch with major game manufacturers, it can be expanded in traditional game channels, so that the standard plug-in based on web3 economic circulation has customizable programming conditions, and prepare for the upgrade of the built-in SDK module.**
In the standard plug-in, the protocol is the foundation, but in large games, the standard algorithm obviously cannot meet the needs of multi-modal scenes. The solution of traditional manufacturers is also modular development, such as physics engine, modeling, rendering layer, etc., there are also strategies for local deployment. 

These are undoubtedly the driving forces for promoting the development and transformation of the game industry. But in the web3 field, these things are all centralized architecture, and there is no credible and reliable thing to link them. Although the game public chain can solve some economic model bookkeeping, etc., it cannot solve the economic distribution in the game or effective marking and trust. This makes the chain game itself a pseudo-concept in the underlying layer.
The birth of the Geeks Union standard plug-in and protocol can solve this problem, but the functional attributes are still difficult to meet user needs when applied to large-scale scenes. To avoid multiple car manufacturing and possible repeated calls or secondary compilation of the basic protocol, the Geeks Union will upgrade the product to meet the customized programming conditions and realize the development of the SDK, providing more game manufacturers with a hot-swappable SDK standard module. 

This greatly reduces the work of secondary compilation of the economic model in game development. Users only need to set the standard module to meet the economic game custom economic model. For web3, this is a revolutionary creation. The Geeks Union will be committed to this, and work hard for the future.
**4. "Racer Expert" will conduct a transition test via cosmos before completing the SDK and forging a freely pluggable gaming infrastructure that seamlessly crosses the chain. Create a no-threshold gaming experience on and off the chain.** 
**Through the SDK pluggable localised deployment solution, create a private chain through the Racing Dare game ecosystem, realising the unmanaged creation of custom smart contracts (game-like protocols) by B-end users. Realise the built-in curation protocol and economic model distribution.**
Geek Union will conduct a transition test via cosmos before completing the SDK, which is the basis for cross-chaining. It is also an important transition for standard plug-ins and protocols to the traditional market.
Conventional chain games will always make a trade-off when implementing on-chain behavior, either choosing to go all on-chain and give up immediacy, or choosing the latter and only on-chaining valid assets. The latter is undoubtedly friendly to the gaming experience, but fails to achieve economic mutual trust and can be seen as fully centralized.
The Geek Union then provides a solution to this problem. Based on the addition of efficient Tps and localized deployment, the Geek Union provides open programmable options for the gaming side, allowing the economic model to operate in a complete Turing black box, eliminating the possibility of doing evil.
At the same time, Geek Union's lightweight proprietary link ensures the rate of network response, making the chain game experience exactly the same as the traditional game experience.
Through the proprietary link enchantment and contract customization deployment, B's end users can realize the use or flow of economic models without hosting. Provide a new curation platform and economic scenario for innovative protocols.
Through the above technical practices, Geek Union will independently create a set of passive curation protocols, and effective interactions with Geek Union will be tagged with metrics to realize the creation of the above economic scenarios. This provides creators and users with the possibility of maximizing economic benefits, which is worth looking forward to.

**5.based on the standard plug-ins and protocols of the SDK, and the effective application of curatorial protocols, to create web3 field of the first game industry based plug-in distribution platform.**
